## Question 3:
## Run the following commands to create a data frame in R with measurements for
## 30 men describing their height in centimeters, weight in kilograms, and a 
## logical indicator for whether they have a daughter or not.
set.seed(31)
heightsCM <- rnorm(30,mean=188, sd=5)
weightsK <- rnorm(30,mean=84, sd=3)
hasDaughter <- sample(c(TRUE,FALSE), size=30, replace=T)
dataFrame <- data.frame(heightsCM,weightsK,hasDaughter)

## Subset a data frame to only the individuals that are greater than 188
## centimeters tall. Assign this subset to a data frame called dataFrameSubset. 
## Then run this command: mean(dataFrameSubset$weightsK) to get the average 
## weight among this subset of men in the data. What is the value produced?
dataFrameSubset <- dataFrame[dataFrame$heightsCM>188,]
mean(dataFrameSubset$weightsK)

## Question 4:
## Run a command to generate 100 Cauchy random variables with default parameters
## and assign them to a vector cauchyValues after running the command
set.seed(41)

cauchyValues <- rcauchy(100)

## Then run a command to sample 10 values with replacement from cauchyValues 
## immediately after running the command
set.seed(415)

sample(cauchyValues,10,replace=TRUE)[1:3]
